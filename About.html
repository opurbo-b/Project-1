    <p>  Hello, my name is Opurbo Bhuiyan and I'm currently enrolled at Kennesaw
        State University and majoring in Information Technology. I have always
        had a strong passion for anything computer-related. When I was a child,
        my dad always made me tinker and mess around with anything related
        to computers because he worked as a storage engineer. Ever since then, I
        have loved to create and innovate new projects with coding. I would also
        use old hardware to build my computer. As of right now, I'm
        planning on pursuing a career in cybersecurity. Some qualifications I
        have are:
